# welcome to <span class="accent">it<strike>t</strike>y</span>

This all started as a fun code-golfing experiment ([itty-router](https://npmjs.com/package/itty-router)), attempting to make a tiny, elegant micro-router for use in service workers, specifically the incredibly powerful/lightweight [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/).  By 2022, this tiny router (especially when used with [extras](https://npmjs.com/package/itty-router-extras)) has become one of the mainstays of serverless routing, especially within the Cloudflare Workers community.

This path has continue on to handle much of the ecosystem of both API generation (including [response handling](https://npmjs.com/package/itty-router-extras) and [CORS](https://npmjs.com/package/itty-cors)) and API [consumption/interaction](https://npmjs.com/package/itty-fetcher).  Each library typically rests in the ~500 byte range, to keep both your code *and* your bundle sizes down.

## and... itty.industries?

In October 2022, itty industries, LLC. was formed to encompass & protect the development of these open-source initiatives, as well as begin the development of several free/commercial tools (to be announced shortly) under the "itty" brand.  Additionally, the free-to-use browser extension [Retheme](https://retheme.org) will be brought under the itty umbrella to continue support and development of that as well.
